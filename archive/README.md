# Archive Directory

This folder contains legacy / ad-hoc debug and temporary scripts retained for historical reference.

## Archived README variants

Deprecated or superseded README files have been moved to `archive/readmes/` to keep the repository root clean while preserving history:

- `archive/readmes/README_COMPREHENSIVE.md`
- `archive/readmes/README_CONSOLIDATED_DRAFT.md`
- `archive/readmes/README_web_dashboard.md`
- `archive/readmes/README_2025-10-21.md`

Prefer the canonical `README.md` at the repository root for current documentation.

Files here are excluded from normal maintenance and may be removed in a future major release.

Do not add new code directly; prefer structured tooling or documented examples under `scripts/`.
